## 1. Overview

The partner’s implementation focuses on a **MinHeap** data structure built in Java using generics (`T extends Comparable<T>`).
It includes the essential heap operations:

* `insert(T item)`
* `extractMin()`
* `decreaseKey(int index, T newValue)`
* `merge(MinHeap<T> other)`
* `buildHeap(List<T> items)`
* `minHeapify(int i)`

The heap elements are stored inside an `ArrayList`, and the project also includes a performance tracker that counts operations such as comparisons, swaps, and array accesses.
Overall, the structure is modular and easy to follow, with clear separation between algorithm logic, metrics, and testing.

## 2. Algorithmic Complexity

| Operation         | Description                                                     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **insert()**      | Adds an element and restores heap order upwards.                | O(log n)        | O(1)             |
| **extractMin()**  | Removes the smallest element and restores heap order downwards. | O(log n)        | O(1)             |
| **decreaseKey()** | Decreases a key and shifts the node upward.                     | O(log n)        | O(1)             |
| **merge()**       | Combines two heaps and rebuilds the structure.                  | O(n + m)        | O(n + m)         |
| **buildHeap()**   | Builds a heap from an unordered list.                           | O(n)            | O(1)             |

The implementation correctly maintains the **min-heap property** (`parent ≤ children`) through percolate-up and percolate-down operations.
Recursion is used in `minHeapify`, and although elegant, it could cause stack depth issues on very large datasets.

## 3. Strengths of the Implementation

* **Generic and Reusable** — works with any comparable type, not just integers.
* **Well-structured and readable code** — functions are short, clear, and logically named.
* **Performance tracking built in**, which is useful for theoretical vs practical complexity analysis.
* **Error handling** — operations like `extractMin()` on an empty heap throw appropriate exceptions.

Overall, the code demonstrates a solid understanding of heap behavior and good software engineering practices.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

| Aspect            | Issue                                                                  | Suggested Improvement                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `merge()`         | Concatenates two lists and calls `buildHeap()`, which is costly.       | Implement a more efficient merging strategy (e.g., pairwise heap merge). |
| `minHeapify()`    | Recursive — may cause overhead on large heaps.                         | Convert to iterative heapify for better memory efficiency.               |
| `ArrayList` usage | Slight overhead in frequent `get()` and `set()` calls.                 | Consider using a simple array for large-scale operations.                |
| `decreaseKey()`   | Relies fully on `compareTo` — possible issues with custom comparators. | Allow optional custom comparator for flexibility.                        |

These optimizations are not critical for correctness but would improve performance, especially for larger input sizes.

## 5. Comparison with My MaxHeap Implementation

| Feature             | Nursaya’s MinHeap          | My MaxHeap                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Heap type           | Min-oriented               | Max-oriented               |
| Data structure      | Generic (`ArrayList<T>`)   | Array of integers          |
| Heapify direction   | Downward                   | Upward                     |
| Merge strategy      | Full rebuild (`buildHeap`) | Element-wise insert        |
| Complexity tracking | Yes (PerformanceTracker)   | Yes (PerformanceTracker)   |
| Efficiency          | Flexible and educational   | Optimized for numeric data |
| Error handling      | Detailed                   | Simplified                 |

**Summary:**
Nursaya’s MinHeap prioritizes **clarity and generality**, while my MaxHeap focuses more on **efficiency and speed**.
Her implementation is better suited for academic demonstration and reusability across types, while mine performs faster on numerical datasets due to reduced overhead.

## 6. Experimental Analysis (Expected Trends)

Based on the theoretical model and performance metrics, the following trends are expected when testing on random input arrays:

| Operation | Input Size | MinHeap Comparisons | MaxHeap Comparisons |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Insert    | 1,000      | ≈ 10,000            | ≈ 9,000             |
| Extract   | 1,000      | ≈ 12,000            | ≈ 11,000            |
| Merge     | 2×1,000    | ≈ 40,000            | ≈ 18,000            |



## 7. Recommendations

1. Replace recursive heapify with an **iterative** version.
2. Improve `merge()` performance by using incremental heap merging instead of full rebuilds.
3. Add a **Comparator<T>** option for more flexibility with non-natural orderings.
4. Consider using primitive arrays instead of `ArrayList` for time-critical applications.
5. Include performance plots and CSV outputs for benchmarking results.

## 8. Conclusion

Nursaya Amirman’s MinHeap implementation is **accurate, well-structured, and pedagogically strong**.
It achieves all required operations with correct asymptotic complexity and clear organization.
While there are minor optimization opportunities in merging and recursion handling, the code successfully demonstrates a deep understanding of heap mechanics and algorithmic design.

In comparison, my MaxHeap shows stronger raw performance but is less flexible.
Together, these two implementations complement each other well — illustrating both orientations of the heap structure and allowing direct complexity comparison between them.
